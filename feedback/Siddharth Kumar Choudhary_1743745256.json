{"feedback": [{"question": "What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?", "answer": "So in a list, all the items present in a list are of same type and for the couple there can be different types that are together.

While the candidate attempts to highlight a difference, the core distinction is missed.", "strengths": ["Attempt to explain a difference between lists and tuples", "Showed some understanding of data structures"], "improvements": ["Correct the factual inaccuracy: lists can contain items of different types.
